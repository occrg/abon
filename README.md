# Abon: A website for a startup ready-meal producer

### Overview
This project was initially to build a website for the Bristol environmentally conscious food startup, Abon. It was shelved in May 2019 due to University exams and then the startup's finder putting his startup aside for a full-time job. I am now continuing with the project but using different frameworks as a learning exercise.

### Requirements
The high-level requirements for the website are as follows:
* Users must be able to order Abon's products
* Administrators must be able to view and manage orders
* The website must be mobile-friendly
