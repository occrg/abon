# Abon

## Overview
This project is to build a website for local environmentally conscious food startup, Abon. It was initially submitted as coursework to the University of Bristol by Oliver Ryan-George and Kwame Dogbe but is now being extended upon by Oliver to be suitable for publishing.

Customers will be able to learn about the company and its products as well as purchase the products directly online. The administrator will be able to edit the website's information as well as manage orders from their own user interface after logging on.
