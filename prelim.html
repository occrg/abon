    <h1>Preliminary Submission Explanation</h1>
      <h2>Current Progress</h2>
        <p>Some work has been done on front and backend. Frontend work can be seen in ./frontend and backend work can be seen by starting the server in ./site with the command "node server.js". A pseudo-frontend has been created to demonstrate the backend's capabilities. The design of the frontend and functionality of the backend will later be merged.</p>

      <h2>Justifications</h2>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>HTML produced and validated on all pages so far. A majority of HTML done from scratch.
          Have dealt with a number of issues for example displaying text over and image, and working with
          complex carousel structures etc.</p>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>Used a combination of Bootstrap and our own CSS to apply styling to the pages. Have good 
          level of confidence with bootstrap grids, containers, responsive breakpoints
          and many other bootstrap features</p>
        <h3>JS</h3>
          <p>Created files to handle animations of some features. Hover animations for Products page
          and sine waves (squigily lines) to partition sections. Also augumented code to deal with input spider 
          and to handle removal of items from table on products page.</p>
        <h3>PNG</h3>
          <p>Images converted to png files, cropped, and colour corrected using Photoshop 
            (which provided more features than GIMP). Also deleted image backgrounds to produced images of 
          less conventional shapes as can be seen on home page.</p>
        <h3>SVG</h3>
          <p>Put a good amount of effort into creating simple but appealing SVGs produced images by freehand drawing
          over a template. Simplified paths of SVGs as well.</p>
        <h3>Server</h3>
          <p>Sends html files, js files and JSON objects to frontend. Manipulates database.</p>
        <h3>Databases</h3>
          <p>Database initialised server loads testimonials from it and sends to client side.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic pages</h3>
          <p>Header and footer loaded from server onto every page. Testimonials dynamically loaded onto testimonials page.</p>
